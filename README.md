### Thirdly, I created the Jenkins job and set the credentials to be able to connect to AWS. Then, I set up the Terraform connection with main.tf file to create AWS EC2 instance in the Jenkins pipeline.
### Finally, I built the Jenkins pipeline and connected to the EC2 instance created on AWS and installed the necessary environments on the machine (helm, docker, kubernetes, go etc.)
